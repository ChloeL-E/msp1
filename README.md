<!--![Responsive Mockup]()-->

## Features

### Existing Features

- **Navigation Bar**
  
  - The responsive navigation bar has been applied to all four pages so that the pages are uniform, which is more visually appealing and improves user experience. It is also 'sticky' so that it is visible at all times no matter where the user is on the webpage. The navigation bar includes clear links to the logo, Home, Treatments, Contact Us and 'Book Now' button.
  - The navigation section promotes ease of use for the user, allowing the user to move easily between sections and pages.

<!--![Nav Bar]()-->

- **The hero image**

  - Each page includes an striking image with text overlay and an eye catching zoom animation.  This aims to be instantly visually appealing to the user to peak their interest, whilst also showcasing one of the Spas' impressive facilities.

<!--![Landing Page]()-->

- **Our Story Section**

  - The Our Story section that is found on the Home page will allow the user to see the Spas' ethos, with the aim to show the benefits to the resotative treatments and some self-indulgence. There are 3 images to add visual appeal and interest to the page, whilst also showcasing the Spa.
  - The user will see the value of a luxury Spa experience and will consider making a booking enquiry via the site.
  

<!--![Our Story section]()-->

- **Treatments page**

  - This page will allow the user to see exactly what treatments are available to book. Images are paired with the treatment information to show the user what the treatment may look like. When the user hovers over an image, an overlay appears to show the duration and cost of the treatment they are viewing.
  - This page will be updated with any new treatments available or seasonal offers.

<!--![Treatments]()-->

- **The Footer**

  - The footer section includes links to the social media sites for Hexham Manor Spa. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.
  - The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media and gives easy access to interesting information about what is happening at the Spa.

<!--![Footer]()-->

- **Contact Us**

  - The gallery will provide the user with supporting images to see what the meet ups look like.
  - This section is valuable to the user as they will be able to easily identify the types of events the organisation puts together.

<!--![Contact Us]()-->

- **The Book Now Page**

  - This page will allow the user to send a booking enquiry. The user will be asked to submit their full name, email address and telephone number. The user will have the option to give some further information with the booking enquiry. The user will recieive feedback once they press the submit button to inform them that they will be contacted soon regarding their booking enquiry.

<!--![Book Now]()-->

### Features Left to Implement

- In the future a 'book online' feature will be implemented which will allow the user to directly book their treatments online rather than sending a booking enquiry/needing to speak to a memebr of the Spa team. This should improve user experience and they can more efficiently book our services. 

## Testing

- The WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool was used to assess each webpage. 

- The Home page showed no errors or contrast errors but identified two alerts. The firstly there was not alt atrribute to identify the 'Book Now' button. An alt tag was added which fixed the alert.
-There was also an alert identified with the Hamburger toggle. The function requires a click which would not be accessible to keyboard users.

- The Treatments page identified no errors or contrast errors. 

- The Contact Us page identified no errors or contrast errors. One alert was identified which showed a redundant link. The logo links to the home page as well as the Home link in the header. Adjacent links go to the same URL, therefore the logo link was removed to improve efficiency of movement through the webpage for screenreaders.

- The Booking page showed two errors when the WAVE Tool was applied. The first alert was for a missing form label  and the second eroor for an empty button. 


<!--In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.-->

### Validator Testing

- HTDocument checking completed. No errors or warnings to show when passed through official [W3C validator]()
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [Jigsaw validator]()
 


### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
  In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
