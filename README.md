## Design

-   ### Features
    * Responsive on all device sizes 

    -   #### Navigation Bar
        * The responsive navigation bar has been applied to all four pages so that the pages are uniform, which is more visually appealing and improves user experience. It is also 'sticky' so that it is visible at all times no matter where the user is on the webpage. The navigation bar includes clear links to the logo, Home, Treatments, Contact Us and 'Book Now' button.
        * The navigation section promotes ease of use for the user, allowing the user to move easily between sections and pages.

       ![Navigation Bar](documentation/navbar.jpeg)

       * On a mobile device the navigation bar utilises a hamburger menu to improve appearance and user experience.

       ![Navigation Bar- mobile device ](documentation/navbar-mobile.jpeg)

       * The Hamburger menu uses Javascript to open and close the hamburger menu when it is 'clicked' and when 'open', the navbar links slide across the page and become visible to the user.

       ![Navigation Bar- mobile device- hamburger menu open](documentation/navbar-mobile-open.jpeg)

    -   #### Hero Images
        * There is a striking hero image on each webpage to attract the attention of the user. 
        * Each hero image, apart from the hero image on the Booking Page, have a hero zoom animation applied. 


        ![Hero Image example](documentation/hero_readme.jpeg)

    -   #### Our Story Section

        * The Our Story section that is found on the Home page will allow the user to see the Spas' ethos, with the aim to show the benefits to the resotative treatments and some self-indulgence. There are 3 images to add visual appeal and interest to the page, whilst also showcasing the Spa.
        * The user will see the value of a luxury Spa experience and will consider making a booking enquiry via the site. 


       ![Our Story Section](documentation/our-story-section.jpeg)

    -   #### Treatments page
        * This page will allow the user to see exactly what treatments are available to book. Images are paired with the treatment information to show the user what the treatment may look like. When the user hovers over an image, an overlay appears to show the duration and cost of the treatment they are viewing.
        * This page will be updated with any new treatments available or seasonal offers.


        ![Treatments Section](documentation/our_story_section.jpeg)

    -    #### Contact Us Page
         * The map will provide the user with a visual aid to see the location of the spa.
         * This section is valuable to the user as they will be able to easily identify the the location of the spa and how to contact the spa if they require.

         * The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media and gives easy access to interesting information about what is happening at the Spa.


        ![Footer](documentation/footer.png)

-   ### Features For The Future
    * In the future a 'book online' feature will be implemented that will allow the user to directly book their treatments online rather than sending a booking enquiry/needing to speak to a member of the spa team. This should improve user experience and they can more efficiently book our services. 

-   ### Accessibility

    * The WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool was used to assess each webpage [wave](https://wave.webaim.org/)

    * The Home page showed no errors or contrast errors but identified two alerts. An alt attribute to identify the 'Book Now' button. An alt tag was added which fixed the alert. An alert identified with the Hamburger toggle. The function requires a click which would not be accessible to keyboard users. ![Wave tool result](documentation/wave_tool.jpeg)
    * The Treatments page identified no errors or contrast errors.
    * The Contact Us page identified no errors or contrast errors. One alert was identified which showed a redundant link. Adjacent links go to the same URL (logo and home), therefore the logo link was removed to improve efficiency of movement through the webpage for screenreaders. 
    * The Booking page showed two errors. For a missing form label and for an empty button. These errors were corrected. 
      
    -    #### Validators
         * W3C Markup Validator, W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate this project to ensure that there were no syntax errors.
