## Design

-   ### Colour Scheme
    * The colour palette used for Hexham Manor Spa's website was created using [coolors](https://coolors.co/) ![screenshot of colour palette used](documentation/coolors.png)
    * This colour palette was created using natural, calm, cool colours that compliment the spa's elegant aesthetic, encapsulating peace and traquility. 
    * There is a range in the colours within the palette so that a good contrast is achieved at all times between text and background-colors.

-   ### Typography
    * The Noto Serif Sans font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the backup font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Noto Serif Sans is a high-quality font developed specifically for easy online consumption. It is a user-friendly, beautiful clean and crisp typeface that compliments the design.

-   ### Imagery
    * Imagery has an important role in the website. The large, hero image on each page is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. Each image was chosen for its natural, relaxing feel and deep colours. The images aim to add a cosy, luxurious atmosphere in-keeping with the spa's aesthetic. They also give the user a good insight into the physical look of the spa.

## Structure

-   ### Features
    * Responsive on all device sizes from 260px

    -   #### Navigation Bar
        * The responsive navigation bar has been applied to all four pages so that the pages are uniform, which is more visually appealing and improves user experience. It is also 'sticky' so that it is visible at all times no matter where the user is on the webpage. The navigation bar includes clear links to the Home, Treatments, Contact Us and Book Now pages.
        * The navigation section promotes ease of use for the user, allowing the user to move easily between sections and pages.

       ![Navigation Bar](documentation/navbar.jpeg)

       * On a mobile device the navigation bar utilises a hamburger menu to improve appearance and user experience.

       ![Navigation Bar- mobile device ](documentation/navbar-mobile.jpeg)

       * The Hamburger menu uses Javascript to open and close the hamburger menu when it is 'clicked' and when 'open', the navbar links slide across the page and become visible to the user.

       ![Navigation Bar- mobile device- hamburger menu open](documentation/navbar-mobile-open.jpeg)

    -   #### Hero Images
        * There is a striking hero image on each webpage to attract the attention of the user. 
        * Each hero image, apart from the hero image on the Booking Page, have a hero zoom animation applied. The zoom animation was removed from the Booking Page as it detracted from the booking enquiry form.

        ![Hero Image example](documentation/heroimage.jpeg)

    -   #### Home page

        * The Our Story section that is found on the Home page will allow the user to see the Spas' ethos and important information, with the aim to show the benefits to the resotative treatments and some self-indulgence. There are 3 images to add visual appeal and interest to the page, whilst also showcasing the Spa.
        * The user will see the value of a luxury Spa experience and will consider making a booking enquiry via the site. 

        ![Home page](documentation/home_page.jpeg)

    -   #### Treatments page
        * This page will allow the user to see exactly what treatments are available to book. Images are paired with the treatment information to show the user what the treatment may look like. When the user hovers over an image, an overlay appears to show the duration and cost of the treatment they are viewing.
        * This page will be updated with any new treatments available or seasonal offers.

        ![Treatments Section](documentation/treatments_page.png)

    -    #### Contact Us Page
         * The map will provide the user with a visual aid to see the location of the spa.
         * This section is valuable to the user as they will be able to easily identify the the location of the spa and how to contact the spa if they require.

         ![Contact Section](documentation/contact_section.jpeg)

    -    #### Booking Page
         * This page will allow the user to send a booking enquiry. 
         * The user will be asked to submit their full name, email address and telephone number. The user will have the option to give some further information with the booking enquiry. 
         * The user will recieive feedback once they press the submit button to inform them that they will be contacted soon regarding their booking enquiry.

         ![Booking Form](documentation/bookingpage.jpeg)

    -    #### Footer
         * The footer section includes links to the social media sites for Hexham Manor Spa. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.
         * The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media and gives easy access to interesting information about what is happening at the Spa.

         ![Footer](documentation/footer.png)

    -    #### 404 Error Page
          * A 404 error page was created to ensure that if, for any reason, the webpage is unavailable, the user is taken to a message page which helps to redirect them back to the website.

         ![404 error page](documentation/404page.png)

    -    #### Thank You Page
          * The user is taken to a Thank you page after submission of the booking enquiry form on the Booking page. This opens in a new browser tab. This improves user experience as they recieve feedback that their enquiry form was sent successfully. The new tab in the browser means the user can easily move back to the website.

         ![Thank you page](documentation/thankyou_page.jpeg)

-   ### Features For The Future
    * In the future a 'Book Online' feature will be implemented that will allow the user to directly book their treatments online rather than sending a booking enquiry or needing to speak to a member of the spa team. This should improve user experience as they can more efficiently book our services. 
    * FAQ page- this would be beneficial to the customer to view answers to commonly asked questions for more insight into the spa.
    * Button taking the user back to the top of the page for easy access back to the top of the page.

-   ### Accessibility

    -    #### Validators

         * W3C Markup Validator, W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate this project to ensure that there were no syntax errors in the project.
         * Markup Validator ![W3C Markup Validator](documentation/w3cvalidator.jpeg)
          - Home Page W3C HTML Validation - Pass
          - Treatments Page W3C HTML Validation - Pass
          - Contact Page W3C HTML Validation - Pass
          - Booking Page W3C HTML Validation - Pass
          - Thank You Page W3C HTML Validation - Pass
          - 404 Page W3C HTML Validation - Pass
         * CSS Validator ![W3C CSS Validator](documentation/w3c_css.png)
          - style.css CSS Validation - Pass
         * Jshint was used to validate the Javascript
          - main.js Jshint - Pass

    -    #### WAVE accessibility tool

    * The website was developed to be as inclusive as possible. The use of semantic HTML, aria-labelling, alt attributes to images and good colour contrast.
    * The WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool was used to assess each webpage [wave](https://wave.webaim.org/)
    * The Home page showed no errors or contrast errors but identified two alerts. An alt attribute to identify the 'Book Now' button. An alt tag was added which fixed the alert. An alert identified with the Hamburger toggle. The function requires a click which would not be accessible to keyboard users. ![Wave tool result](documentation/wave_result.png)
    * The Treatments page identified no errors or contrast errors.
    * The Contact Us page identified no errors or contrast errors. One alert was identified which showed a redundant link. Adjacent links go to the same URL (logo and home), therefore the logo link was removed to improve efficiency of movement through the webpage for screenreaders. 
    * The Booking page showed two errors. For a missing form label and for an empty button. These errors were corrected.

    -    #### Lighthouse 
  Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools are used to test performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the spa Website.
    - Performance was the only issue and the majority of this is due to the images slowing the load time therfore the images used within the content on Home and Treaments page were converted from jpeg to png files. This improved the performance. The hero images to each page were not converted as it did not improve the performance rating but the image quality reduced.
  
  * [See Lighthouse report for Home page](documentation/lighthouse-home.png)

Each action was tested and found to work as expected. 
Chrome developer tools were used to identify and resolve any issues or bugs throughout the development process.

-   ###  Further Testing

    * The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer and Safari browsers.
    * The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, Tablets and Phones using dev tools and real devices.
    * The website was sent to friends and family members to review the site and test it from a user perspective.

-   ### Fixed Bugs
    * The header would not align correctly using bootstrap but the footer did, using flexbox. The header was rewritten to use flexbox and the issue was resolved.
    * The hamburger click functon would not work. On media screens with max-width 600px, the "click" function causes the nav menu to slide out from left to right below the header. Utilising dev tools and console.log to log each click it was clear that the javascript was working but it was the css that was not working as expected. A background-color of red was added to the nav-menu and it was made clear that it needed .nav-menu.active set with left:0. This fixed the problem.
    * The contact-address and contact-detils were misaligned on smaller screen sizes. This was fixed by giving both classes a width and altering the padding on the media queries.
    *  A dark line showed on media screen size max-width 600px when using Chrome dev tools. This was fixed by removing the scroll property.
    * The images had a slow load time, which was highlighted using Lighthouse. This was improved by dowloading the smallest image size, running the images through cloud convert and then using tiny.png to compress it. This improved load times substantially.
